# Linux-command-line
## The Linux command line is a powerful tool for managing and interacting with the Linux operating system
- In Linux, the file system is organized as a hierarchical structure starting from the root directory (/) and branching into subdirectories. It follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), defining where files and directories should be located

- . Core Directories in the Linux File System
/ - Root Directory

- The top-level directory, containing all other directories and files.
/bin - Binary (Executable) Files

- Holds essential command binaries, like ls, cp, mv, that are needed for system operation.
/boot - Boot Files

- Contains boot loader files like the Linux kernel, initial RAM disk (initrd), and bootloader configuration (grub).
/dev - Device Files

- Contains device files for hardware and peripherals, allowing the system to communicate with hardware (e.g., sda for hard drives).
/etc - Configuration Files

- Contains system-wide configuration files and shell scripts to start or stop individual programs.
/home - User Home Directories

- Each user has a personal directory here, like /home/username, for personal files and settings.
/lib - Libraries

- Contains essential libraries needed by binaries in /bin and /sbin.
/media and /mnt - Mount Points

- Used to temporarily mount external drives, like USB drives and CDs.
/opt - Optional Software

- For third-party software and add-on applications.
/proc - Process Information

- A virtual filesystem that provides information about running processes and system information.
/root - Root User’s Home

- Home directory for the root user (superuser).
/sbin - System Binaries

- Contains essential system binaries, typically for root user or superuser tasks (e.g., iptables, reboot).
/tmp - Temporary Files

- Holds temporary files created by users and applications.
/usr - User Programs and Data

- Contains user-installed software and applications. It has subdirectories such as /usr/bin, /usr/lib, and /usr/local.
/var - Variable Data Files

- Contains files that are expected to grow in size, like logs in /var/log, temporary mail files in /var/mail, and databases.
Linux File System Types
Different file system types are optimized for different use cases:

- ext4 — Extended Filesystem 4: The default for many Linux distributions. It is reliable and has journaling, which protects against data corruption.

- XFS — High-performance file system suited for large files and scaling.

- Btrfs — Next-gen file system with advanced features like snapshots, RAID support, and error detection.

- ZFS — Known for excellent data integrity and scalability. It supports snapshots and high redundancy.

- FAT32/exFAT — Compatible with most operating systems; used mainly for USB drives or external storage that needs cross-OS compatibility.

- NTFS — Native to Windows but can be read/written to by Linux with the right drivers.
